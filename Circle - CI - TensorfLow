-> workflow of MLOps contains : -> Data Platform and Analytics System (gathers Data) 

-> CI - MLops: Gatheed data -> Data pipeline -> Store in system -> Data clean Process -> Desired output verifed by expert -> deploy

-> Best MLOps practice means -> Quality of model and outcome produced by model -> these 2 depends on Speed at which data can train and retain the model and 
                                                                                  quality of data you feed your model

CIRCLE - CI -> CI/CD Platform, well suited for MLOps Automation
            -> It build Fully Byspoke pipelines, Performs almost any task in both magnaged and cloud hosted executipn Environment
            -> Itâ€™s powered by Git, so your CI/CD pipelines integrate with your existing tools 
            -> just add a CircleCI configuration file to your project, and you can start automating.

TensorFlow Image recognition ML workflow:
===========================================

-> TensorFlow image recognition is a machine learning workflow where TensorFlow, a popular open-source library, is used to identify and classify objects within images. 

-> It involves training a neural network on labeled image data to recognize patterns and features. Once trained, the model can predict labels for new, unseen images.

=> A simple example of TensorFlow image recognition is a model trained to recognize different types of fruits.

-> You provide a dataset with labeled images of apples, bananas, and oranges.

-> The TensorFlow model learns to identify features like shape and color during training.

-> When you show the model a new image of a fruit, it predicts whether it's an apple, banana, or orange based on the learned patterns.
