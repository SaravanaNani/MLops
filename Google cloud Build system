Google Cloud Build:
==================
-> Google Cloud Build is a fully managed continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform provided by Google Cloud.
-> It automates the process of building, testing, and deploying applications or services in the cloud.

 Google Cloud Build is a tool from Google Cloud that helps automate the process of:

-> Building: Turning your source code into ready-to-use files (like apps, Docker images, or websites).

-> Testing: Checking if your code works as expected (e.g., running tests).

-> Deploying: Sending your code to servers or services (like Cloud Run, Kubernetes, or App Engine) so users can access it.

=============
Key Points:
=============

-> It uses temporary machines to do the work.

-> You tell it what to do in a simple file (called cloudbuild.yaml).

-> It works with code stored in places like GitHub or Google Cloud.

-> The results (like Docker images or app files) can be saved in Google Cloud services like Container Registry or Cloud Storage.

==================
Example Use:
==================

-> Imagine you're working on a website:

-> You push your code to GitHub.

-> Cloud Build gets triggered automatically.

-> It builds your website, runs tests, and uploads the final version to a storage bucket or a server.

=============================================================================================================

-> Cloud Build saves time by automating repetitive tasks, 
-> so you can focus on writing code instead of worrying about how to get it ready for use.

Googel Build system vs Jenkins:
--------------------------------

-> Not exactly. Google Cloud Build and Jenkins both serve as build systems for automating CI/CD pipelines, but they are distinct tools.


Google Cloud Build:
===================

-> A fully managed service by Google Cloud.

-> No infrastructure setup required.

-> Natively integrates with Google Cloud services.

Jenkins:
=========

-> Open-source and self-hosted.

-> Requires manual setup and maintenance.

-> Flexible and supports numerous plugins for customization.
===============================================================================================================
-> While both are build systems, Cloud Build is specific to Google Cloud, whereas Jenkins can run anywhere.
