Here’s a simplified explanation of how to build and deploy a microservice on Google App Engine using Go:

### 1. Environment Setup

  -> Use the Google Cloud Shell for convenience; it has the gcloud CLI pre-installed.
  -> Learn more about App Engine commands by typing:

```
gcloud app --help
```
### 2. Create a Go App Structure

-> Create a directory for your app:

```
mkdir go_app
cd go_app
```

-> Add a configuration file (app.yaml):

 - This file specifies the App Engine runtime.
 - Example content for app.yaml:

```
runtime: go115
```

-> Create the main Go file (main.go):

 - Write a simple Go program:
   
```
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "net/http"
    "os"
)

func indexHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintln(w, "Hello, World! GCP Certification")
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", indexHandler)
    port := os.Getenv("PORT")
    if port == "" {
        port = "8080"
    }
    log.Printf("Starting server on port %s...", port)
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":"+port, nil))
}
```
### 3. Deploy the Application

-> Deploy to App Engine:

```
gcloud app deploy
```

-> Review and confirm the deployment when prompted.

  - View the deployed app:

```
gcloud app browse
```
  - This opens your app in a browser. If not, it provides the URL.

### 4. Monitor and Update

-> Tail logs to view real-time requests:

```
gcloud app logs tail
```
-> Make updates:
  - Modify the source code (e.g., main.go).
  - Redeploy the app:

```
gcloud app deploy
```

### 5. Additional Tools
   
-> Use the GCP Console for:
   
   - Monitoring dashboards.
   
   - Viewing billing and server load.
   
   - Managing traffic to different app versions.

This setup allows you to build, deploy, and monitor microservices easily on App Engine with minimal configuration!
