#Refer Flow differnce diagram

Data Lake: Think of a messy storeroom filled with raw data—structured (like spreadsheets), unstructured (like PDFs), 
           or streaming (like live IoT feeds). For instance, raw customer data from online purchases.

Feature Store: This is like a refined pantry for ML models. 
                You clean and process the messy data (e.g., extract customer spending habits, average order size), 
                then store these reusable and high-quality "features" for training machine learning models.

Example: Predicting customer churn uses clean features like "average time between orders" or "last order amount."

Data Warehouse: It’s like a well-organized library for business reporting. Data here is clean and structured, 
                but mainly used for dashboards or business intelligence.

Example: Generating a monthly sales report or tracking regional performance trends.

Key Difference:

-> Feature Store = For AI/ML systems (training and prediction).

-> Data Warehouse = For business insights (dashboards and reports).

Both turn raw data into valuable insights but serve different purposes.
