In the context of MLOps, a vendor refers to a company or service provider that offers tools, platforms, or
services to support the various stages of the machine learning lifecycle (from data preparation to deployment and monitoring).

-> A vendor essentially provides the tools and infrastructure needed to operationalize machine learning workflows effectively

==================================================================================================================================
What Vendors Provide in MLOps:

Infrastructure:
====================

-> Compute resources for training models (e.g., GPUs, TPUs).

-> Cloud-based or on-premises solutions for running ML workloads.

Examples: AWS, Google Cloud, Azure.

Tools and Platforms:
======================

-> Model Training: Frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or proprietary platforms.

-> Data Engineering: Tools for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and ETL pipelines (e.g., Databricks).

-> Model Deployment: Serving models in production (e.g., AWS SageMaker, Google Vertex AI).

-> Monitoring and Management: Tracking performance, identifying data drift, and retraining (e.g., MLflow, Weights & Biases).

Automation and CI/CD:
=======================

-> Automating pipelines for data, training, testing, and deployment (e.g., GitHub Actions, Google Cloud Build).

End-to-End Platforms:
======================

-> Unified solutions that handle the full ML lifecycle in one system.

-> Examples: Google Vertex AI, Databricks MLflow, AWS SageMaker, Azure Machine Learning.

=====================================================================================================================================

Why Vendors Are Important in MLOps:

-> Simplify Complex Workflows: Vendors provide pre-built solutions that save time and effort.

-> Scalability: They enable handling large-scale ML operations seamlessly.

-> Integration: Many vendors offer tools that integrate well with existing ecosystems.

-> Support: Vendors often provide technical support and updates to improve reliability.

Example Vendors in MLOps: 
=======================

-> Cloud Platforms: AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure.

-> Open-Source Platforms: MLflow, Kubeflow, TensorFlow Extended (TFX).

-> Specialized Tools: Weights & Biases, Seldon, DVC.
