Here’s a simple explanation with a real-world analogy:

Static Data Example: Imagine a jar filled with red and black balls.
                     As you draw more balls, you get a better understanding of the ratio of red to black because nothing is changing inside the jar.

Dynamic Data (Data Drift): Now imagine the jar has a secret trapdoor, and a child is secretly adding new balls of random colors (red, black, or even blue) while you’re drawing. 
                           This changes the ratio constantly, so no matter how many balls you pull, your earlier understanding becomes unreliable.

Real-World Data Drift: In machine learning, data drift happens when the data used to train the model starts to change in the real world. 
          
          For example: a spam filter trained on old email patterns may fail as new spam techniques emerge.

Solution: To handle data drift, you need to regularly retrain your model with updated data to keep it accurate and aligned with the current situation.
