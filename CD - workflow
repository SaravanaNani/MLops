Here’s a simplified explanation of the Continuous Delivery workflow:

-> Cloud-based Development: Developers often use cloud environments (e.g., AWS Cloud 9, GitHub Codespaces) to work in setups similar to production, ensuring consistency.

-> Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Code and infrastructure definitions are pushed together. IaC defines all aspects of the cloud or Kubernetes environment and ensures changes are consistent.

-> Build and Test: Code changes trigger automated builds and tests. If successful, the infrastructure is provisioned or updated.

-> Idempotent IaC: IaC ensures changes happen only if needed (e.g., won’t recreate an existing resource unless modified).

-> Environment Setup: IaC can create separate environments (e.g., staging for testing or production) as needed, allowing flexibility for updates or testing.

-> Resource Cleanup or Expansion: IaC also simplifies resource cleanup or adding new resources.

-> Controlled Deployments: Changes can be pushed to various environments (e.g., staging, production) without directly affecting production until reviewed.

This process ensures safe, repeatable, and efficient delivery of updates.
